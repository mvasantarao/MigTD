# MigTD Code Review

Domain-specific guidance for reviewing the Intel MigTD codebase. Codifies the trust model, build-feature scope, common false-positive patterns, lessons learned from previous reviews, and the verification workflow.

---

## 1. High-Level View (read this FIRST)

Most failed/regressed "fixes" in this codebase trace back to skipping this section. Internalize these properties before flagging anything.

### Execution model

- **Single-core, single-threaded `no_std` Rust firmware**. No `Sync`/`Send` races within one TD. There is no preemption between non-interrupt code paths.
  - Do **not** flag missing locks, atomics, or `Send` bounds unless an interrupt handler mutates shared state.
- **Heap is ~7 MiB**, bump-allocator behaviour for some paths. Out-of-memory is recoverable but rare.
- **Async runtime is cooperative** (`async_runtime` crate, single-threaded executor). Futures run to suspension; "races" between awaits are not races in the classical sense.

### Trust model

- **VMM is untrusted but has inherent DoS capability** — it can starve the TD, stall vmcalls, drop packets, withhold cycles, or kill the TD. **DoS-via-VMM is NOT a finding.** Do not file issues that boil down to "the VMM could refuse to make progress".
- **Root of trust = hardware attestation registers**: `MRTD` and `RTMR0..RTMR3`. The QE/PCK chain is a transport, not the root.
  - Root CA used by `policy_v2` is **measured into RTMR and attested**. So "weak cert chain validation" reports against the verifier are usually false-positives — chain compromise alone is insufficient.
- **Trusted-after-init**: `mig_policy::init_policy()` verifies and freezes a signed policy. Everything inside `VERIFIED_POLICY` after init is trusted; treat reads from it as authenticated.
- **Two distinct attestation paths**:
  - *Regular migration* → uses **quotes**. REPORTDATA at byte offset **520**. Helper: `verify_report_data_binding`.
  - *Rebind* → uses **TDREPORT** (no quote). REPORTDATA at byte offset **128**. Helper: `verify_tdreport_data_binding`.
  - **Mixing the two = bug.** Always trace which helper is called from each rebind/migration code path. See commit `94975ec` for the TH1 binding fix.

### Boundary surfaces (where bugs actually live)

- The **vmcall transports** (`vmcall-raw`, `virtio-vsock`, etc.): every byte coming from VMM must be size-checked. Wrap-around arithmetic on `u32` offsets is a real risk; integer overflow on `u64` is generally not exploitable on 64-bit.
- **TLS-over-vmcall** in `crypto/`: certificate parsing, ASN.1, PEM. Look for slice indexing, `find()` ordering, and PEM block delimiters.
- **Policy parsing/verification** in `policy/src/v2/`: JSON deserialisation, PEM chain building.
- **Event log / RTMR replay** in `migtd/src/event_log.rs` and upstream `cc-measurement`: bounds checks, off-by-ones, RTMR replay correctness.
- **FFI / over-the-wire structs**: anything sent between source and destination MigTDs or exchanged with td-shim must be `#[repr(C)]` (or explicitly serialised).

### What looks like a bug but isn't

- "VMM can supply OOB buffer offsets" → each migration ctx has its own shared buffer with `data_status` as ground truth.
- "`vmcall-raw` read returns 0 → infinite loop" → the transport blocks until data or error; it **never returns Ok(0)/EOF**.
- "Interrupt broadcast wakes all migrations" → per-buffer `data_status` check filters spurious wakes (correct by design).
- "TSC division by zero in calibration" → pre-conditioned by CPUID/feature detection on real hardware.
- "Unbounded heap allocation in peer-info parse" → bounded by mig session size limits and the 7 MiB heap. DoS only.
- "`ecdsa_sign` PKCS8 panic" → dead code; no callers in the production binary.
- "Missing `#[repr(C)]` on `ExchangeInformation`" → dead code behind `#[cfg(not(feature = "spdm_attestation"))]` in the in-scope build.
- "Misspelled identifier" → fix only if user-visible; do not churn internal names.

### Patterns that look like style fixes but are actually load-bearing

This is the most important class to internalise. **Do not "clean up" code that looks redundant without first proving it is redundant.**

- **`event_log::get_event_log()` returns `&raw[..size + 1]`**, not `&raw[..size]`. The `+1` looks like an off-by-one but is a deliberate workaround for a bug in upstream `cc_measurement::log::CcEvents::next()` (uses `<` instead of `<=`), which silently drops the last event when the slice ends exactly at the last event boundary. The runtime CCEL area is zero-padded so the extra byte is safe. **Removing the `+1` breaks AzCVMEmu integration tests** (lost policy tag → `Failed to initialize migration policy`). Upstream issue: <https://github.com/confidential-containers/td-shim/issues/848>. Regression test: `event_log::tests::last_event_visible_only_with_trailing_padding`.
- **Comments documenting workarounds are mandatory**. If you find code that does something odd without a comment, add the comment before considering changing the code.
- **CI history is the source of truth for "what broke when"**. If a regression appears, find the breaking commit via `git bisect` or by reading CI run history; do not guess from local symptoms (which may be masked by other environment issues — see §6).

### Why these matter

A previous review pass produced a "fix" (`bc99fa4`) that removed the `+1`, passed cargo fmt/clippy and the host-runnable unit tests, but silently broke the EMU integration tests. The breakage was not caught until CI history was inspected. The lesson: **passing `cargo test` is not sufficient evidence of correctness for changes that touch boundary code; always run the EMU integration tests after every behavioural change.**

---

## 2. Codebase essentials

- **MANDATORY first step after fresh checkout / submodule update**: run `bash sh_script/preparation.sh`. This:
  1. Invokes `deps/td-shim/sh_script/preparation.sh` (td-shim's own prep).
  2. Applies the spdm-rs ring patches (`0003-introduce-EphemeralPrivateKey-serialization.patch` and `0004-Introduce-digest-de-serialization.patch` from `deps/spdm-rs/external/patches/ring/`) to `deps/td-shim/library/ring`. These patches add serialization methods that `spdmlib` requires; without them, `cargo build --features spdm_attestation` fails with missing-symbol errors (`EphemeralPrivateKey::to_bytes`, `digest::serialize`).
  3. Runs `deps/spdm-rs/sh_script/pre-build.sh`.
  CI does this automatically via `.github/actions/setup-build-environment` (default `run-preparation: true`). Locally you MUST run it manually after any `git clean -fdx`, `git submodule update`, or fresh clone. Failing to run it produces build errors that look like a real baseline regression but are not.
- **Build profiles vary**. Always confirm scope before flagging code as buggy. Default in-scope set used during the audit:
  - `vmcall-raw, stack-guard, main, vmcall-interrupt, oneshot-apic, spdm_attestation, igvm-attest, policy_v2`
  - `policy_v2` pulls in `policy/policy_v2` + `attestation/attest-lib-ext`.
  - **Out of scope in that profile**: `virtio-serial`, `virtio-vsock`, `vmcall-vsock`, `fuzz`, `AzCVMEmu` runtime (the host-side emu harness is separate from the in-firmware build).
- **Always in tree** (regardless of features): `virtio`, `pci`, `crypto` (rustls enabled by default).
- **Build (production image)**:
  ```bash
  cargo image --features main,vmcall-raw,stack-guard,vmcall-interrupt,oneshot-apic,spdm_attestation,igvm-attest,policy_v2
  ```
  - The xtask sets release/debug profile internally — do **not** pass `--release`.
- **Build (AzCVMEmu host harness)**: see §6.
- Bigger build cmd (matrix): `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- Architectural facts:
  - `ring::pkcs8::Document` in **this fork** is stack-inlined `[u8; 185]` + `len`, NOT heap-allocated → `sensitive_data_cleanup` works as intended.
  - `verify_quote_integrity_ex` is a C-library built from source as a submodule.
  - `policy_v2` policies are signed JSON + an `issuer_chain` PEM. Both must be regenerated together — mismatch yields `SignatureVerificationFailed`.

---

## 3. Common false-positive patterns

| Pattern | Why it's usually NOT a bug |
|---|---|
| "VMM can supply OOB buffer offsets" | Each migration ctx has its own shared buffer; `data_status` is ground truth. Wrap arithmetic on `u32` offsets is checked. |
| "Shared log circular buffer overflow" | Wrapping logic keeps offsets in bounds; VMM is reader, not writer. |
| "vmcall-raw read returns 0 → infinite loop" | The `vmcall-raw` transport blocks until data or error; **never returns 0/EOF**. |
| "Interrupt broadcast wakes all migrations" | Spurious wakes are caught by per-buffer status check (correct by design). |
| "Cert chain weakness in attestation/SPDM verifier" | Root CA is measured into RTMR; chain compromise alone is insufficient. |
| "TSC div-by-zero in calibration" | Pre-conditioned by CPUID/feature detection on real HW. |
| "Unbounded heap alloc in peer-info parse" | Bounded by mig session size limits + 7 MiB heap → just DoS. |
| "Misspelled identifier" | Fix only if user-visible; don't churn the codebase for internal names. |
| `ecdsa_sign` PKCS8 panic | Dead code — no callers in the production binary. |
| `ExchangeInformation` missing `#[repr(C)]` | Dead code behind `#[cfg(not(feature = "spdm_attestation"))]` in this build. |

## 4. Known real bug patterns

Fixes already merged that double as templates for what *real* bugs look like:

1. **Match-arm fallthrough** in `match … { _ => { … } }` blocks where caller expects early return → check every arm for explicit `return` (see `poll_vmcall_completion`, commit `ed80789`).
2. **Missing `#[repr(C)]`** on FFI / serialized-over-the-wire structs → see `HelloPacketPayload` (commit `a277723`).
3. **Wrong field used for crypto-algorithm lookup**: `cert.signature_algorithm` (the signer's algorithm) vs `cert.tbs_certificate.subject_public_key_info.algorithm` (the subject's algorithm used to verify the cert *under* the subject's pub key) → commit `70872c0`.
4. **PEM search order**: `find(END)` before `find(BEGIN)` allows END before BEGIN → search for END *after* BEGIN's end-index (commit `dfb449c`).
5. **Missing TH1 binding on SPDM rebind path**: rebind uses `TDREPORT` (REPORTDATA at offset **128**), regular migration uses quotes (REPORTDATA at offset **520**). They need distinct verification helpers (`verify_tdreport_data_binding` vs `verify_report_data_binding`). See commit `94975ec`.

---

## 5. The verification cycle (DO THIS AFTER EVERY FIX)

A fix is not done until **all of these pass — every test in every CI workflow, no exceptions**. The user explicitly requires this. The order matters — fastest feedback first.

### Local quick gate (must all be green before pushing)

```bash
# 0. Preparation (skip only if you've already run it since last submodule update)
bash sh_script/preparation.sh

# 1. Format check (instant)
cargo fmt --check

# 2. Clippy on the in-scope feature set
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets \
    --features main,vmcall-raw,stack-guard,vmcall-interrupt,oneshot-apic,spdm_attestation,igvm-attest,policy_v2 \
    -- -D warnings

# 3. Host-runnable unit tests for the crates you touched (seconds)
cargo test -p migtd --lib <module_you_touched>
# e.g.: cargo test -p migtd --lib event_log
# e.g.: cargo test -p crypto

# 4. EMU integration tests (minutes) — REQUIRED for any change to:
#    - event_log / RTMR replay code
#    - policy parsing or verification
#    - migration session / handshake / rebind paths
#    - SPDM transport
#    - crypto / cert / PEM parsing
#    - any vmcall transport
./sh_script/build_AzCVMEmu_policy_and_test.sh --skip-test  # build first
./sh_script/build_AzCVMEmu_policy_and_test.sh              # then full test run
# OR run individual scenarios via ./migtdemu.sh (see §6).
```

### Full CI parity (all four workflows MUST pass — no exceptions)

The user has stated **every test in every workflow must pass**. The reusable gauntlet script automates this — use it as the standard pre-push verification:

```bash
.agents/skills/migtd-review/scripts/run-ci-gauntlet.sh
```

It runs the four CI workflows in the order `prep → format → deny → main → emu` and **stops at the first failure** with the failing command, the path of the captured log, and a resume hint (`--from <stage>`). Logs land under `target/ci-gauntlet/`. Total wall-clock is ~30 min cold, much less on warm caches.

```bash
.agents/skills/migtd-review/scripts/run-ci-gauntlet.sh --list           # list stages
.agents/skills/migtd-review/scripts/run-ci-gauntlet.sh --from main      # resume from main
.agents/skills/migtd-review/scripts/run-ci-gauntlet.sh --only emu       # single stage
```

When the gauntlet fails, **fix the root cause first, then re-run from the failing stage** — do not skip ahead. The script intentionally bails so a review agent (or you) has time to read the log, propose a minimal fix, and re-verify before continuing.

What each stage covers (the commands the script runs are the source of truth):

| Workflow | Stage | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/format.yml` | `format` | `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo check`, `cargo clippy --features stack-guard,virtio-vsock,virtio-serial,vmcall-interrupt` (no `-D warnings`) |
| `.github/workflows/deny.yml` | `deny` | `cargo deny check advisories`, `cargo deny check sources` (continue-on-error), `cargo deny check bans` |
| `.github/workflows/main.yml` | `main` | 32 `cargo image` builds = 4 devices × 2 policy_versions × 2 protocols × 2 build_types |
| `.github/workflows/integration-emu.yml` | `emu` | 14 EMU scenarios mirroring the workflow matrix exactly, including the explicit `cargo build --features AzCVMEmu,...` pre-builds for the four `*-skip-ra` scenarios |

**Note**: the format.yml clippy step uses a *different* feature set than the in-scope set above (`stack-guard,virtio-vsock,virtio-serial,vmcall-interrupt`). Both must compile cleanly; the former is what runs in CI and gates merges.

**Why step 4 is mandatory**: passing `cargo test` is not sufficient evidence of correctness for boundary code. Unit tests in `migtd` exercise small, controlled inputs; many real bugs only surface when the full source ↔ destination migration handshake replays the event log, parses a real signed policy, or extends RTMRs. The bc99fa4/event_log regression is the canonical example — host unit tests passed; EMU integration tests failed loudly.

If `cargo image` succeeds (full TDX firmware build) that's a strong signal the change at least compiles for the no_std target, but it does not exercise runtime behaviour. The EMU harness does.

### EMU test failure debugging order

If an EMU test fails after a fix:

1. **First**: check the CI run history on GitHub to see whether the same test passes for an unrelated commit on `main`. If `main` is also failing the test in CI, the failure is pre-existing (environment, OpenSSL, runner image) — see §6.
2. **Then**: `git bisect` (or scan recent commits) to find the breaking commit. The narrative "my fix broke it" is often correct; the narrative "the failure is unrelated" is often wrong.
3. Only after you have a specific breaking commit, reason about *why* — typically by reading the diff in light of §1.

---

## 6. Running EMU integration tests locally

Prerequisites: Rust 1.88.0, nasm, clang, libtss2-dev, pkg-config, jq, and `bash sh_script/preparation.sh` has been run (see §2).

Working tests on Ubuntu 24.04 (skip-RA paths):

```bash
./migtdemu.sh --skip-ra --both --no-sudo --log-level info
./migtdemu.sh --operation rebind-prepare \
    --policy-file ./config/AzCVMEmu/policy_v2_signed.json \
    --policy-issuer-chain-file ./config/AzCVMEmu/policy_issuer_chain.pem \
    --skip-ra --both --no-sudo --log-level info
./migtdemu.sh --skip-ra --features spdm_attestation --both --no-sudo --log-level info
```

Full test matrix script (mirrors `.github/workflows/integration-emu.yml`):

```bash
./sh_script/build_AzCVMEmu_policy_and_test.sh --mock-report
```

### Policy file gotcha — `EXPLICIT_POLICY_FILE`

- `config/AzCVMEmu/policy_v2_signed.json`, `config/AzCVMEmu/policy_v2_raw.json`, and `config/AzCVMEmu/policy_issuer_chain.pem` are **tracked in git**. CI starts every job from a clean `actions/checkout`, so these are always present.
- `migtdemu.sh` only auto-generates policy files when `EXPLICIT_POLICY_FILE != true` *and* `SKIP_POLICY_GENERATION != true` (see `migtdemu.sh:452`). Passing `--policy-file` sets `EXPLICIT_POLICY_FILE=true`, which **disables** auto-generation. So if you `git clean -fdx` (or otherwise delete the tracked policy files), then run with `--policy-file`, you'll get `Error: Source Policy file not found: …`. Restore them with `git checkout config/AzCVMEmu/` and re-run.
- The key-rotation policy files (`policy_v2_signed_a/b/pm_b/pmi_b.json` + matching chains) are **not** tracked. The rotation scenarios in `integration-emu.yml` generate them on demand.

### Local CI matrix invocations (mirrors `integration-emu.yml`)

Single-instance scenarios (no `--mock-report` or `--policy-v2`):

```bash
./migtdemu.sh --skip-ra --both --no-sudo
./migtdemu.sh --features spdm_attestation --skip-ra --both --no-sudo
```

`policy_v2` + mock-report scenarios (require the tracked policy files):

```bash
./migtdemu.sh --policy-v2 --policy-file ./config/AzCVMEmu/policy_v2_signed.json \
    --policy-issuer-chain-file ./config/AzCVMEmu/policy_issuer_chain.pem \
    --mock-report --both --no-sudo
```

Rebind scenarios use `--operation rebind-prepare`. SPDM scenarios add `--features spdm_attestation`. Key-rotation scenarios additionally pass `--policy-file`/`--policy-issuer-chain-file` pointing at the rotated artifacts (e.g., `policy_v2_signed_a.json`).

### No safe parallelism for `migtdemu.sh`

Do **not** run multiple `migtdemu.sh` invocations concurrently. The script:
- Hardcodes TCP port `8001` (no override flag).
- Uses `taskset -c 0` (all invocations contend on the same core).
- Writes log files at fixed names (`dest_*_out.log`, `migtd_<op>_<role>.log`).
- Builds into `target/release/migtd`, rebuilt per-scenario with different feature sets — concurrent runs will clobber each other's binary.

If you must speed up local CI parity, run scenarios sequentially in a single shell. CI parallelism is achieved per-job in GitHub Actions, where each runner has its own isolated filesystem.

### When CI passes but local fails (or vice versa)

CI failures can mask local regressions and vice versa. If `cargo image` or an EMU test fails locally but the same commit passes in CI on `main`, suspect: missing `preparation.sh`, missing system package, stale submodule, OpenSSL version skew, or deleted tracked policy files. Conversely, if a local change passes but CI fails, do **not** assume the CI is flaky — re-read the §1 trust-model rules first.

---

## 7. Workflow A — Triaging clawpatch findings

```bash
ls .clawpatch/findings/*.json | xargs -I{} jq -r '.findingId + " " + .status + " - " + .title' {}
# Open ones first:
ls .clawpatch/findings/*.json | xargs -I{} jq -r 'select(.status=="open") | .findingId + " - " + .title' {}
```

For each open finding:

1. Open the JSON; read `evidence`, `reasoning`, `reproduction` against the source.
2. Confirm the file/line is **actually compiled** in the in-scope build (check `Cargo.toml` features). Many findings are in vsock/virtio-serial dead code for vmcall-raw.
3. Decide and triage:
   ```bash
   clawpatch triage --finding <id> --status <false-positive|fixed|wont-fix> --note "<concise justification with file:line evidence>"
   ```
4. For *fixed* findings: make a minimal, surgical commit; reference the finding ID in the commit body. **Then run the §5 verification cycle, including EMU integration tests for any boundary-code change.**

Required JSON fields when manually creating a finding (clawpatch finding schema):
`schemaVersion, findingId, featureId, title, category, severity, confidence, triage, evidence, reasoning, reproduction (string not null), recommendation, whyTestsDoNotAlreadyCoverThis (string not null), suggestedRegressionTest (string not null), minimumFixScope, status, history, signature (string), linkedPatchAttemptIds (array), createdByRunId (string), createdAt, updatedAt`.

---

## 8. Workflow B — Manual deep review

Use parallel `explore` agents (Haiku) for breadth, then `view`/`grep` for verification. Suggested chunking:

- Agent 1: `src/devices/**`, `src/std-support/**`
- Agent 2: `src/spdm/**`, SPDM transport, attestation glue
- Agent 3: `src/migtd/src/main/*`, migration session, policy
- Agent 4: `src/crypto/**`, `src/attestation/**`, `src/policy/**`

Prompt each agent to read **only files compiled in the target build**, return findings as a structured list (file:line, severity, description, suggested fix). Then *you* verify each finding against the source before filing — agents will hallucinate; the trust model in §1 catches most hallucinations.

---

## 9. Workflow C — Filing GitHub issues for the audit

See `scripts/create_review_issues.sh` template. Important details:

- Use `[Copilot Review]` prefix in the title (not `[Security]`) — not every finding is a security concern.
- Microsoft org requires SSO; **EMU (Enterprise Managed User) accounts cannot create issues** — use a personal GitHub account with `gh auth login --hostname github.com --web` (device-flow login). Verify the active account with `gh auth status` before running create scripts.
- `gh issue close` uses `--reason "not planned"` (with a literal space), NOT `not_planned`.
- For each issue body file: include Title, Severity, File:line, Description, Triage Status (Fixed / False-positive / Wont-fix), and Triage Notes from the clawpatch finding.
- Before running the create script, scan all body files for duplicated triage-note sentences and empty triage-notes sections; cross-check empty ones against the original clawpatch JSON (the `triage.notes` array — multiple entries should be concatenated, deduplicated, and de-fluffed).

---

## 10. Workflow D — Filing upstream issues for cross-repo bugs

Some bugs surface in MigTD but live in submodules (`deps/td-shim`, `deps/spdm-rs`, etc.). When you confirm one:

1. Identify the upstream repo via `.gitmodules`.
2. Search existing issues + PRs (open and closed) for the symptom and the symbol names. Try at least 3–4 wordings.
3. Verify the bug still exists on upstream `origin/main` (the submodule SHA may be stale).
4. File an issue containing: a self-contained reproducer, the affected file:line, downstream impact, and a proposed fix. Offer to send a PR.
5. In the MigTD-side workaround, **add a code comment referencing the upstream issue URL** so the workaround is not removed later.
6. Add a **regression test** in MigTD that mirrors the upstream reproducer; phrase the assertion so it fails loudly when upstream fixes the bug, signaling that the workaround and test can be removed. Example: `event_log::tests::last_event_visible_only_with_trailing_padding`.

---

## 11. Things to avoid

- **Don't fix unrelated pre-existing issues** uncovered during review unless they are *directly coupled* to the change. If a pre-existing fmt/style issue blocks `cargo fmt --check` for your commit, fix it as a **separate** standalone commit with a clear "pre-existing; not caused by this series" note in the body — do not bundle it into a behavioural commit.
- **Don't churn formatting/lint across the codebase**. `cargo fmt` only touches files you've already modified; do not run it repo-wide.
- **Don't add `.clawpatch/` or `.copilot-review-issues/` to source control** — they are gitignored.
- **Don't "fix" code that looks redundant without proving it is redundant.** See §1's discussion of `event_log::get_event_log()`. The standard test is: revert your fix, run the EMU integration tests; if they break, the code was load-bearing.
- **Don't trust local symptoms when CI tells a different story.** A `SignatureVerificationFailed` locally on Ubuntu 24.04 can mask an entirely unrelated regression (or vice versa).
- **Don't pile new commits on top of an incorrect commit.** If a commit is wrong, use `git rebase -i` to drop or fold it (`fixup`/`squash`) before pushing. Force-push with `--force-with-lease=<branch>:<known-sha>` to a personal fork only; never to a shared branch.
